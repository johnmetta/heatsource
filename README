Heat Source is a computer model used by Oregon DEQ to simulate stream thermodynamics and hydraulics. It was developed in 1996 by Matt Boyd as a Masters Thesis at Oregon State University in the Departments of Bioresource Engineering and Civil Engineering and programmed in Visual Basic as an Excel macro. In 2006, I (John Metta) and Dan Turner redeveloped it from the ground up as a Python program while we were both working for the DEQ Watershed Management division. 

DEQ currently maintains the official Heat Source methodology and source. Details are available at http://www.deq.state.or.us/wq/TMDLs/tools.htm. This version is a branch that I will be advancing development on as I have time, and hopefully merging with the official DEQ through and ongoing collaboration with the DEQ Watershed Management Division.
